# Database

We are going to explore two ways how to access database from Grails from Vaadin code. The first approach is GORM (Grails Object Relation Mapping), which is the defualt way to access database in Grails.

The second part shows how to integrate Grails with other than GORM database frameworks and how to use it in Vaadin.
