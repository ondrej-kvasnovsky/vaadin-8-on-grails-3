# Vaadin on Grails 3

The book describes integration between Vaadin and Grails frameworks. The book starts with tutorial how to create and setup project. 

We will go through two approaches how to work with database. The first one is GORM, which is the default option. And then three alternatives to GORM that are MyBatis, JdbcTemplate and Groovy Sql.

We will at look data binding tricks, basic ideas for architecture and how to compose the components using Model View Presenter (MVP).

The book also contains tutorials how to compile SASS and widget set, after you add an add-on. How to use Spring security, localization and how to add a REST API from a Vaadin application and many other things.

If you are completely new to both technologies, the book will show you first steps to start up development and then you can continue with [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/learn) and [Grails](http://grails.org/doc/latest/guide/single.html) documentation.

If you are both Vaadin and also Grails expert, you might look at the book as a reference book, set of tutorials and also a place with several solutions that you might have to solve in your applications.

## Behind The Scenes
This book could be written thanks to:
* Questions you have been asking during last few years about development of Vaadin using Groovy and Grails.
* Many years spend with development of applications using Grails and Vaadin.
* Chapter about Grails in [Vaadin 7 Cookbook](http://www.packtpub.com/creating-rich-internet-applications-in-vaadin-7/book) that showed there is more to be discovered.
