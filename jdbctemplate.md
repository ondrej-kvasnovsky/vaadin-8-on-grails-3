# JdbcTemplate

[JdbcTemplate](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/JdbcTemplate.html) provides simple way to execute SQL queries.

It can prevent your code from SQL injection. You can also provide mappers that will map result set to your domain classes.
