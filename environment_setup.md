# Environment setup

We are going to learn how to setup environment in order to start with development of Vaadin application in Grails.

Before you start, make sure Java is installed on your machine. If not, follow the [instructions by Oracle](how to install java, oracle) for macOS, Linux or Windows.

Also make sure you have got the latest version of Grails on your local machine. Type `grails --version` in your console to find out what version is installed. You should see something like this:

```
| Grails Version: 3.2.8
| Groovy Version: 2.4.10
| JVM Version: 1.8.0_131
```

In case you do not have Grails installed on your machine, follow the instructions in this chapter.
