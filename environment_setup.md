# Environment setup

Before you start, make sure Java is installed on your machine. If not, follow the [instructions by Oracle](how to install java, oracle) for macOS, Linux or Windows.

Also make sure you have got the latest version of Grails on your local machine. Type `grails --version` in your console to find out what version is installed. You should see something like this: 

```
| Grails Version: 3.1.7
| Groovy Version: 2.4.6
| JVM Version: 1.8.0_60
```

In case you do not have Grails installed on your machine, follow the instructions in the next sections.
